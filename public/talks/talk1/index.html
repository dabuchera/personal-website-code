          Development of a cloud-based Common Data Environment for purposes of a construction company

    <p>The topic of the Common Data Environment (CDE) is based on the idea of linking a collaborative project space with the cloud technology. It should then be possible for all project participants to move increasingly towards an integral approach of project management. This means that methods of the BIM process can be used more frequently in later project phases in addition to the planning phases, and the efficiency and optimization of the construction process can be optimized by involving all actors during a project. Taking up this fact, in the following work, a systematic and technically oriented approach is chosen to propose a structure, in the sense of a system architecture, on the basis of an extension of the current consideration of a cloud-based environment. By interpreting selected BIM application cases, this should show to what extent an implementation is useful for a construction company and which aspects have to be considered during the conception and implementation. The first step was to develop a conceptual understanding of the model of a CDE, based on a review of relevant literature and current technological developments. Furthermore, these findings show a reference value with regard to the requirements and methodologies of the BIM process for the recommendation of a new structure. In the second step of this work, the different core components to be considered for the construction are presented, and a detailed explanation of the proposed structure is given. In addition to the definition of system architecture and database structure, this also includes the design of user types, their areas of responsibility and effects on the business organization. Furthermore, this proposal will be analyzed by a first implemented prototype, and further development possibilities will be presented. Finally, the proposed structure will be used to classify the CDE issue regarding the digitization of the construction industry and to show the extent to which such a development is relevant for research and the construction industry through presenting opportunities and risks.</p>
