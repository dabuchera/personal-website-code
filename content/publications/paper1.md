The Common Data Environment (CDE) is seen as an opportunity to increase collaboration and efficiency during project handling and act as a basis for Industry 4.0 in the construction industry. CDE developments in industry and research use various approaches to collaboration and interoperability. Past attempts to conceptualize these approaches have been limited to an open versus closed dichotomy. This paper suggests a new conceptualization for interoperable CDE's is needed. A three-dimensional paradigm for interoperable CDE development is proposed. Such an understanding makes it possible to more clearly define CDE interoperability and conceptualize links between Building Information Modeling, the CDE, and enterprise-level platforms such as digital twins.
