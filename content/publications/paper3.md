There is a need to collect, store, and share product data to enable circularity in industrialized construction supply chains. To do this, the concept of a Material Passport (MP) has been proposed, but exactly how MPs should be created and managed is less understood, especially in consideration of industrialized construction product platforms. This paper proposes a knowledge and process representation framework called the Material Passport Ontology (MPO). The MPO outlines key components of MPs and their interrelationships. Finally, the paper discusses several implementation challenges and possibilities.
