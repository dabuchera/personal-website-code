One emerging strategy in industrialized construction is the use of mass customization to increase product efficiency without sacrificing design flexibility. Effective implementation of mass customization can be done through a product platform, i.e. a configurator. However, existing configurators often lack integration of knowledge from the downstream supply chain such as manufacturing. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for a configurator unified through a manufacturing kit-of-parts. Kit-of-parts are pre-engineered and pre-designed digital models representing fabrication-ready components. Using production rules and restraints, accurate planning and design representations can be derived and utilized in the configurator. This research develops a configurator prototype using three-tier architecture. The prototype supports a low-to-high level of detail of kit-of-parts. It integrates product platforms and project development across multiple building phases including site planning, floor plan layout, and 3D model generation. Finally, the implementation of a modular building configurator illustrates the benefits of the proposed configurator-based workflow.
