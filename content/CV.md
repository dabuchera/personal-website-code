I am a PhD Candidate at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/), at the department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatics Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Daniel Hall.](https://ic.ibi.ethz.ch/).

I'm convinced that Data has the potential to help us tackle a variety of social, environmental, and economic problems. Solving the most significant challenges requires data sharing and efficient data management within organizations and tools and between partners and across the system. As this system approaches an era of distributed technological integration (e.g., Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0), the built environment will need to adapt.

However, data fragmentation and a scattered system of data islands prevent efficient data usage based on effective data management and governance systems. Overall, the benefits of distributed technological integration can help make the construction's data sets more consistent, efficient in use, and finally, useable for all participants.

The overarching goal of my research is therefore as follows: First, it should present how the integration of web 3.0 concepts can address challenges in data management of current solutions. Second, the consequent concepts from this integration should then be applied to new innovative approaches such as decentralized data marketplaces, which will be assessed for applicability and implication to improve data processing in construction.Â 

With this vision in mind, my interests lie in various new technological concepts such as [Decentralized Databases](https://ipfs.io/), [Blockchain](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/de/pages/strategy-operations/articles/blockchain-explained.html), [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/), and [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) and its application to the construction industry.
